//Q11- Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

//Q12- Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

// let names: string[] = ["sadia","kashif","hassan","farah"]; 
// console.log(names[0]);
// console.log(names[1]);
// console.log(names[2]);
// console.log(names[3]);
// task #12
let names: string[] = ["sadia","kashif","hassan","farah"]; 
let message: string = "do you like to play crickt ?";
console.log( names[0] + " " +message);
console.log( names[1] + " " +message);
console.log( names[2] + " " +message);
console.log( names[3] + " " +message);
